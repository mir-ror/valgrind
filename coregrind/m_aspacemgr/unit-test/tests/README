Use  ./runtest  to run the tests.
The output is self-explanatory.

Each test reads a segment tree from a file and inserts a segment.
The segment tree after insertion is written out as a ".dot" file
which can be visualised with the "dv" script included in this
directory.

To run a test by hand, e.g.

./unit-test big -i 15:45

Here "big" is a file containing a segment tree.
This will create big-i15:45.dot and you can look at it like so:

./dv big-i15:45.dot

You can also omit the .dot suffix.
